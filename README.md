# Overview
The **ADI 3DToF ADTF31xx** is a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for working with ADI’s ADTF3175D ToF sensor. This node captures the Depth and IR frames from the sensor and publishes them as ROS topics. The node uses [*ADI ToF SDK*](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ToF/) APIs to capture frames from the sensor. The node publishes Depth and IR Images at 512x512 (16 bits per image) resolution and Camera Info @ 30FPS.

>>```
>
>  3. Ensure rmw settings are updated in the device to support muti-sensor usecases
>>```bash
>> #Update the default rmw xml profile file to the settings file present inside "rmw_config" foler
>> $ export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE= ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx/rmw_config/rmw_settings.xml
>>#Next restart ROS daemon for the profile changes to take effect
>>$ ros2 daemon stop
>>```
> - The above mentioned steps for rmw settings setup can also be completed by running the "setup_rmw_settings.sh" script present inside the "rmw_config" folder.
>>```bash
>>$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx/rmw_config
>>$ chmod +x setup_rmw_settings.sh
>>$ source setup_rmw_settings.sh
>>```

>    Note: `/home/analog/ros2_ws/` is set up as the ros2 workspace and this workspace is already sourced in the `~/.bashrc`

7.	Running the ROS Node:

    On the Device:
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py
    ```

    >:memo:*Note:*   
    >The demo may not work if WSL is used as the Host machine

    At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* will be launched and start publishing the topics ```/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ir_image and /cam1/camera_info```.

    To see the depth and IR images on the Host machine, simply open the RVIZ2 and add ```/cam1/depth_image``` and ```/cam1/ir_image``` topics to visualize the images

8.  The Node supports sending the Depth and IR images as compressed streams using RVL compression. To publish the compressed images set the ```arg_enable_depth_ir_compression``` parameter to ```1``` in the launch file.  
    The topic names for the compressed Depth and IR images are ```/cam1/depth_image/compressedDepth``` and ```/cam1/ir_image/compressedDepth``` respectively.  

    The users can run the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_compressed_image_subscriber_node*  on the Host to machine to visualize the synchronized depth and ir images in RVIZ.

    Refer to the [Appendix 1](#steps-to-run-the-node-on-a-host-machine-in-file-io-mode) for instructions on how to build the node on a Host machine.  
    
    To run the node run the following command 
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_compressed_host_launch.py
    ```
    This launch file will run the Host node which decompresses the incoming images, computes the Point-cloud and publish the raw images. The launch file also invokes ```adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_raw.rviz``` for visualization.

# Appendix 1 : 
# Steps to run the Node on a Host machine in File-IO mode
The Node can be run on a Host machine without the need for the actual 3D ToF sensor. This mode is supported for users who would want to test some algorithms on the recorded video files. In this mode the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* will read the video file and publish the frames as ROS topics. Follow the below instructions to build and run the node in File-IO mode.

*Note:* It is assumed that the correct version of ROS is installed and configured properly, if not please install the ROS from [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) 

## Requirement on file-io input video files
To run the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* in file-io mode, the video files should be given as input.
Please follow the below instructions to set up the input video files.
1. Go to the installation directory of the *ADI 3DToF ADTF31xx* appliation (~/Analog Devices/ADI3DToFADTF31xx-Relx.x.x)
2. Run the *get_videos.sh* script which will download the *adi_3dtof_input_video_files.zip* file in the current directory.
3. Unzip it and copy the directory as *~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_input_video_files*.
4. Update the input file argument *arg_in_file_name* in the launch file *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py* as per the above file path.

## Steps to run *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* node

1. Clone the repo and checkout the corect release branch/
tag into ros2 workspace directory

    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx.git -b vx.x.x
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/
    $ rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src    
    ```
3. Build the package
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    $ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --cmake-args -DHOST_BUILD=TRUE
    $ source install/setup.bash
    ```

4. To run the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* in File-IO mode, we need to make some changes in the launch file. Change the following parameters in launch file.

    *arg_input_sensor_mode* to be set to *2*
    
    *arg_in_file_name* to be set to the input file name

5. After updating the launch file, run the roslaunch with the updated launch file.
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py
    ```

At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* will be launched and start publishing the topics ```/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ir_image and /cam1/camera_info```.

To see the depth and IR images open an other Terminal and open the RVIZ and add ```/cam1/depth_image``` and ```/cam1/ir_image``` topics to visualize the images


# Steps to convert rosbag file to bin file
[rosbag2](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2), a utility provided by ROS, is used to record topics. The data is collected in bag format, and the adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node node converts it to bin file format. 
The format of bin file as given below.
```
start of bin file

4 byte uint32_t = total frames in bin file.
4 byte uint32_t = image width.
4 byte uint32_t = image height.
4 byte uint32_t = number of bytes per pixel.
4 byte uint32_t = version of generated binary file.
4 byte uint32_t = first frame position( End of header position).
4 byte uint32_t = frame pitch ( number of bytes in one frame).
8 byte long = device timestamp.

till first frame position some header bits are present.
Here header bits are camera_info
K ( 9 doubles = 72 bytes)
size of D ( 1 uint32_t = 4 bytes)
D ( based on size of D, size of D * double)
R ( 9 doubles = 72 bytes)
P ( 12 doubles = 96 bytes)

a single frame contains..
8 byte depth timestamp, depth data, 8 byte IR timestamp, IR data.

n number of frames

end of bin file
```

## Steps to use adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node:
Change below parameters in ```adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_launch.py``` file

1. arg_in_file_name : The rosbag2 file name

2. arg_camera_prefixes : Camera prefix, more than one camera prefixes can be passed. For example if the recoreded topic names are /cam1/depth_image and /cam2/depth_image, arg_camera_prefixes can be set to "[cam1,cam2]"
									  
4. Run the below command to launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node node
   ``` 
   $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_launch.py
   ```
5. The output files will have names in following manner: **input_file_name_camera_name_out.bin**   
   Ex: if input file name is ```4cameras.bag``` and camera prefix is ```cam5``` then output is ```4cameras_cam5_out.bin```  

## Why this is required?
    Our first question is, "Why is it necessary to convert collected bag files to binary format before performing file IO?" Why can't we use FileIO directly while subscribing to ros topics that rosbags publishes? The reason for this is that rosbags may store images in a disorganized order rather than in a sequential manner. For this reason, in order to produce the output, the FileIO code must queue up the publishing rosbag images and synchronize the depth and IR images. The FileIO process becomes slower as a result.
