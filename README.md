    Refer to this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for instructions.

    > :memo:  
    > 1. **Setting Date/Time:**  
    >Make sure the Date/Time is set properly before compiling and running the application. Connecting to a WiFi network would make sure the Date/Time is set properly. The custom Ubuntu 20.04 image is configured to connect to a network with following SSID and Password by default.  
        ```  
        SSID : ADI  
        Password: analog123  
        ```  
    >You can either setup a network with the above properties or configure the Device to connect to any available network.  
    >Alternatively, the Host machine can be setup as a local NTP server and the devices can be configured to update Date/Time using the Host machine.  
    >Refer to below links for setting and configuring NTP on Ubuntu machines.
    >  - https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=862620  
    >  - https://timetoolsltd.com/ntp/how-to-install-and-configure-ntp-on-linux/  
    > 2. The ROS2 Humble and dependent packages are already installed in the EVAL-ADTF3175D-NXZ image and the source code for the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx* is present in `/home/analog/ros2_ws/src/` folder. The package is also pre-built, hence there is no need to build the package. If the source files need an update, refer to [Appendix 1](#steps-to-run-adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node-node) to see how to build the package.
    > 3. Ensure rmw settings are updated in the device to support muti-sensor usecases
    >    ```bash
    >    #Update the default rmw xml profile file to the settings file present inside "rmw_config" foler
    >    $ export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE= ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx/rmw_config/rmw_settings.xml
    >    #Next restart ROS daemon for the profile changes to take effect
    >    $ ros2 daemon stop
    >    ```
    >   - The above mentioned steps for rmw settings setup can also be completed by running the "setup_rmw_settings.sh" script present inside the "rmw_config" folder.
    >     ```bash
    >     $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx/rmw_config
    >     $ chmod +x setup_rmw_settings.sh
    >     $ source setup_rmw_settings.sh
    >     ```

### Running the ROS Node:

1. On the Device:
    ```bash
    $ source /opt/ros/humble/install/setup.bash
    $ source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py
    ```
    > :memo: *Note:*   
    > The demo may not work if WSL is used as the Host machine

    At this stage, the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* will be launched and start publishing the topics ```/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ab_image and /cam1/camera_info```.

    To see the depth and AB images on the Host machine, simply open the RVIZ2 and add ```/cam1/depth_image``` and ```/cam1/ab_image``` topics to visualize the images

2. The Node supports sending the Depth and AB images as compressed streams using RVL compression. To publish the compressed images set the ```arg_enable_depth_ab_compression``` parameter to ```1``` in the launch file.  
    The topic names for the compressed Depth and AB images are ```/cam1/depth_image/compressedDepth``` and ```/cam1/ab_image/compressedDepth``` respectively.  

    The users can run the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_compressed_image_subscriber_node*  on the Host to machine to visualize the synchronized depth and ab images in RVIZ.

    Refer to the [Appendix 1](#steps-to-run-the-node-on-a-host-machine-in-file-io-mode) for instructions on how to build the node on a Host machine.  
    
    To run the node run the following command 
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_compressed_host_launch.py
    ```
    This launch file will run the Host node which decompresses the incoming images, computes the Point-cloud and publish the raw images. The launch file also invokes ```adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_raw.rviz``` for visualization.
3. When running the ROS node on the host, the Node Supports ```Network mode```. where ToF module is connected to host and host requests frames from ToF module via network. For the host's ros node build instructions, Refer to the section titled "Steps to run the adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node node" under [Appendix 1](#steps-to-run-the-node-on-a-host-machine-in-file-io-mode) and follow steps 1 through 6 to build the node on host. now **update *arg_input_sensor_mode* parameter in adi_3dtof_adtf31xx.launch file to 3**. and launch the node.
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py
    ```

# Appendix 1 : 
## Steps to run the ROS Node on a Host machine
The ROS Node can be run on a Host machine to obtain Depth and AB images. The ROS nodes supports two modes, 1. The Network mode and 2. File-IO mode. 
In Network mode, the wrapper uses libaditof package to obtain the images from the camera and publishes these images as ROS topics. 
In File-IO mode the ROS node reads the images from a file, note that this mode can run without the need for a ToF sensor. This mode is supported for users who would want to test algorithms on the recorded video files. In this mode the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* will read the video file and publish the frames as ROS topics. 
Follow the below instructions to build and run the node on a Linux based Host machine.

*Note:* It is assumed that the correct version of ROS is installed and configured properly, if not please install the ROS from [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) 

### Steps to build and run *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* node


1. Clone aditof SDK
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libaditof.git -b v6.0.1
    ```

2. Update submodules of aditof SDK
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/libaditof
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3. Clone the repo and checkout the correct release branch/
tag into ros2 workspace directory
    ```bash
    $ source /opt/ros/humble/install/setup.bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/adi_3dtof_adtf31xx.git -b v2.1.0
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws/
    $ rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src    
    ```

5. Build the package
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/ros2_ws
    $ colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ source install/setup.bash
    ```

6. Open the launch file(adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch) and update the following parameters
    `arg_input_sensor_mode` : `2` for File-Io and '3' for Network mode
    `arg_in_file_name` : Input file name(only for File_IO mode)
    `arg_input_sensor_ip` : IP Address of the EVAL-ADTF3175D-NXZ module(Only for Network mode)
   
7. After updating the launch file, run the roslaunch with the updated launch file.
    ```bash
    $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py
    ```
At this stage, the `adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node` will be launched and start publishing the topics `/cam1/depth_image, /cam1/ab_image and /cam1/camera_info`.

To see the depth and AB images open an other Terminal and open the RVIZ and add `/cam1/depth_image` and `/cam1/ab_image` topics to visualize the images

### Requirement on file-io input video files
To run the *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_node* in file-io mode, the video files should be given as input.
Please follow the below instructions to set up the input video files.
1. Go to the installation directory of the *ADI 3DToF ADTF31xx* appliation (~/Analog Devices/ADI3DToFADTF31xx-Relx.x.x)
2. Run the *get_videos.sh* script which will download the *adi_3dtof_input_video_files.zip* file in the current directory.
3. Unzip it and copy the directory as *~/ros2_ws/src/adi_3dtof_input_video_files*.
4. Update the input file argument *arg_in_file_name* in the launch file *adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_launch.py* as per the above file path.


#### Build Flags

| **BUILD_READ_ROSBAG_NODE**       | BOOL | FALSE         | Builds a node that converts recorded rosbags to binary files used for FileIO|

## Steps to convert rosbag file to bin file
[rosbag2](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2), a utility provided by ROS, is used to record topics. The data is collected in bag format, and the adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node node converts it to bin file format. 
The format of bin file as given below.
```
start of bin file

4 byte uint32_t = total frames in bin file.
4 byte uint32_t = image width.
4 byte uint32_t = image height.
4 byte uint32_t = number of bytes per pixel.
4 byte uint32_t = version of generated binary file.
4 byte uint32_t = first frame position( End of header position).
4 byte uint32_t = frame pitch ( number of bytes in one frame).
8 byte long = device timestamp.

till first frame position some header bits are present.
Here header bits are camera_info
K ( 9 doubles = 72 bytes)
size of D ( 1 uint32_t = 4 bytes)
D ( based on size of D, size of D * double)
R ( 9 doubles = 72 bytes)
P ( 12 doubles = 96 bytes)

a single frame contains..
8 byte depth timestamp, depth data, 8 byte AB timestamp, AB data.

n number of frames

end of bin file
```

## Steps to use adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node:
Change below parameters in ```adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_launch.py``` file

1. arg_in_file_name : The rosbag2 file name

2. arg_camera_prefixes : Camera prefix, more than one camera prefixes can be passed. For example if the recoreded topic names are /cam1/depth_image and /cam2/depth_image, arg_camera_prefixes can be set to "[cam1,cam2]"
									  
4. Run the below command to launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_node node
   ``` 
   $ ros2 launch adi_3dtof_adtf31xx adi_3dtof_adtf31xx_read_rosbag_launch.py
   ```
5. The output files will have names in following manner: **input_file_name_camera_name_out.bin**   
   Ex: if input file name is `4cameras.bag` and camera prefix is `cam5` then output is `4cameras_cam5_out.bin`  

### Why this is required?
    Our first question is, "Why is it necessary to convert collected bag files to binary format before performing file IO?" Why can't we use FileIO directly while subscribing to ros topics that rosbags publishes? The reason for this is that rosbags may store images in a disorganized order rather than in a sequential manner. For this reason, in order to produce the output, the FileIO code must queue up the publishing rosbag images and synchronize the depth and AB images. The FileIO process becomes slower as a result.
